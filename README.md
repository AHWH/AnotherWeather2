# AnotherWeather2
This is a Weather app but it is an app for me to hone my Android programming skills. It is simple but it had taught me alot. 


## What Can It Do
Well, right now it is able to fetch weather from Forecast.io of Singapore only.

* Clean and minimal design
* Get current weather data
  * Condition
  * Temperature
  * "Feels like" temperature
  * Humidity
  * Pressure
  * Windspeed
  * Visibility
* Get hourly breakdown of what's to come (for the next 24 hours)
* Get weather for upcoming days (up to 8 days)
* Landscape support
* Data is saved and automatically restored when app is first loaded, allowing for **offline use**
* Ability to change units between metric and imperial(us)

## What it can't do now

These are features I wished to implement down the road

* Fancy graphics
* GPS location
* Add more location
